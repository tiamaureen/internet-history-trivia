// Initial State: start game on an intro page with a start button, with a score of zero

// New Question Page: When start button is clicked a new page loads with a countdown, a question, and 4 possible answers

// When one of the four buttons are clicked, if the answer is right there is a visual and auditory signal that it was correct, and if the answer is wrong there is another visual and auditory signal that shows it was wrong, and the score is shown on an indicator. If the countdown stops before an answer was chosen the answer is wrong. Also, a next button appears to take the player to the next question.
